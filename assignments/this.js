/* The four principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of "this" inside of that function
will be the window object. (Window Binding)
* 2. Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is "this". (Implicit Binding)
* 3. Whenever a constructor function is used, "this" refers to the specific instance of the object
that is created and returned by the constructor function. (NEW Binding)
* 4. Whenever JavaScript's call or apply method is used, "this" is explicitly defined. (Explicit Binding)
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
